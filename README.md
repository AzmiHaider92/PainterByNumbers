# PainterByNumber

Hello all,

This is my solution to the Kaggle competition PainterByNumbers: https://www.kaggle.com/c/painter-by-numbers

The goal of the competition is to build a network that learns artists' painting style.  
Example: left and middle painting are Van Gogh's, the right painting is Picasso's. 
The network is built to generate feature vectors for painting in a way that paintings of same artists' feature vectors are closer to each other than feature vectors of paintings of different artists.
